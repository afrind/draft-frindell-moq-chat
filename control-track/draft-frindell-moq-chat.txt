1.  Introduction

   MoQ Chat (moq-chat) is a simple text based protocol for exercising
   MoQ Transport [MOQT].  The protocol allows many participants to join
   a virtual chat room, publish messages to the room and receive
   messages published by others.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   Commonly used terms in this document are described below.

3.  Catalog Format

   The moq-chat catalog is used to determine the list of participants in
   the chat.  The format is a text file with text delta encodings.

   Object 0 in any Group is a complete list of the usernames of the
   participants in the chat at the time the Object was published, one
   per-line.  The first line of Object 0 is the version of the catalog
   format specificaiton.  The format described here is moq-chat catalog
   format version 1.

   Object 0 Example:

   version=1
   alice
   bob
   charlie

   Any Object in a Group with sequence number higher than 0 is a delta
   encoding, with new participants prefaced with a '+' character and
   participants that have left the chat prefaced with a '-' character.
   Every delta encoding object MUST be applied for an endpoint to have a
   current list of participants.

   Delta Encoding Exmaple:

   +daphne
   -bob

   Every username in the catalog MUST be unique.  If an endpoint
   receives a catalog or delta encoding that would result in the same
   username more than once, it MUST close the session with an error.

4.  Chat Operation

4.1.  MoQ Chat Server

   The protocol requires that one entity operate as a chat server.  The
   function of the server is to maintain the list of participants in the
   chat and publish catalog updates.  The server can be a standalone
   server, or can function as a client of a generic relay.

4.2.  Chat ID

   Every chat has a unique ID.  The ID is a string of arbitrary length
   and uniquely identifies the chat.  The creation of chat IDs and
   discovery of the server endpoint is out of the scope of this
   document.

4.3.  Track Names

   The catalog for a given chat is available by subscribing to Track
   Namespace = moq-chat/<id>, Track Name = /catalog.

   The chat stream for a participant with username user is Track
   Namespace = moq-chat/<id>/participants/<user>, Track Name =
   /messages.

   The server also has virtual "control" tracks, with names under Track
   Namespace = moq-chat/<id>/control.

4.4.  Control Channel

   To send commands to the chat server, a participant sends a SUBSCRIBE
   to Track Namespace = moq-chat/<id>/control/, Track Name = /<uuid>,
   where uuid is a random string sufficiently large to be unique within
   the MoQ Scope.  The presencence of the uuid is to bypass any caching
   relays and ensure the SUBSCRIBE reaches the chat server.

   The start and end group and object locations MUST all be set to
   Type=Absolute, Value=0.  There are two additional Track Request
   Parameters defined:

   Command (Key=0x12345): An ASCII string either "join" or "leave".

   Username (Key=0x54321): The name of the user joining or leaving

   The server processes the command, adding or removing the user from
   the catalog, optionally verifying any AUTHORIZATION information
   requried by the server.  If the join or leave is successful, the
   server sends a SUBSCRIBE_OK immediately followed by SUBSCRIBE_FIN,
   since the request was for 0 objects.  If the command failed, the
   server responds with a SUBSCRIBE_ERROR with an appropriate error code
   and reason phrase.

   When a moq-chat server processes a command, it MUST update the
   catalog track.  It can either publish a new Group with the updated
   particiant list, a delta encoding against the current Group, or both.

4.5.  Joining a Chat

   In addition to sending a SUBSCRIBE to the control track to join the
   chat, a participant SHOULD SUBSCRIBE to the chat's catalog to get the
   participant list and subsequent participant updates.  It is
   RECOMMENDED the participant request the catalog starting from the
   latest Group using Start Group = RelativePrevious/0, Start Object =
   Absolute/0.  If the participant wishes to operate in "All-Broadcast,
   No Receive" Mode, it can omit subscribing to the chat catalog.

4.6.  Subscribing to Chat Messages

   After receiving the most recent catalog information, a client SHOULD
   subscribe to the track for each active participant.

   Upon receiving a delta update removing a participant, a client SHOULD
   unsubscribe from that track if it had previously subscribed.

   Upone receiving a delta update adding a participant, a client SHOULD
   subscribe to the new track.

4.7.  Chat Messages

   Each chat message is sent in a new Group and new Object.  The format
   of a chat chat message for version 1 catalogs is UTF-8 Encoded text.
   There is no limit to the length of a chat message beyond those
   imposed on QUIC streams.

4.8.  Leaving the Chat

   When a participant leaves the chat, they SHOULD send a SUBSCRIBE_RST
   on their messages track to any subscribers indicating the final group
   and object.  The participant SHOULD also send leave command.  A
   particpant might be disconnected from the chat server in an
   ungraceful manner and be unable to send these messages.

4.9.  Stream Mapping

   There is no prescription for how to map catalog or chat messages onto
   QUIC streams.  Endpoints can choose to use one stream per track, one
   stream per group or one stream per object.

4.10.  Session Closure by the Server

   If a client detects a MOQT session has been closed by the server, it
   assumes the server has exited or crashed, and does not attempt to
   reconnect.  If the server transmits a Goaway, the client MAY
   reconnect if a non-empty New Connect URI is provided
